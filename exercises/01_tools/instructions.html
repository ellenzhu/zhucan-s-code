    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This exercise is meant as a gentle introduction to the git workflow 
      used during this course. You will learn how to clone your git project
      to a computer, edit a file, <em>add those edits</em>, commit your changes
      and finally push them to your repository at GitLab. We check the
      exercises/01_tools/hello.html in your GitLab repository and expect to
      see the following changes (editing the file is easiest part of this 
      exercise):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Document hello.html will be valid html5</li>
      <li>Content of the meta element with the name of author will be changed</li>
      <li>Content of em with the id of signature will be changed</li>
      <li>The changed meta and #id will be the same</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Short Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Install git (if not already installed) to your computer</li>
      <li>Generate and set your SSH key to GitLab</li>
      <li>Clone your wsd-material project to your local computer</li>
      <li>Solve the exercise as detailed in the description</li>
      <li>Add your changes, commit them and then push your commit to GitLab</li>
      <li>Submit Exercise to A+</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Detailed instructions</h2>
  <h3>1. Installing git</h3>
  <p>
    If you work from Paniikki you can skip to the next section, git is already installed.
    You can also test if git is installed by just typing <code>git</code> in terminal.
  </p>

  <p>If you do not have git already installed on your computer, where you
   intend to work, you can download git for various platforms from the 
   official site: <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a>.
   The Windows installation package includes Git Bash that you should use to run
   the terminal commands given through out the course instructions.</p>

  <p>There are also graphical tools for git, such as <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/egit/">EGit for Eclipse</a>
  that you can use but no support for these are provided.</p>

  <h3>2. Generate and set SSH key</h3>
  <p>To enable cloning your project the your local computer you need to add a SSH key to your GitLab profile. </p>
  <p>Follow the instructions on <a href="https://git.niksula.hut.fi/help/ssh">how to generate a SSH key</a>
  and then add that key to GitLab (found at <a href="https://git.niksula.hut.fi/profile">https://git.niksula.hut.fi/profile</a>)</p>
  <pre>
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
# (you should type enter to all questions)
$ cat .ssh/rsa_id.pub
# (use window menu or right click to mark and copy the key in Git Bash)</pre>

  <h3>3. Cloning a project</h3>
  <p>Now you are ready to clone your project on your local machine. 
    Choose a directory and type:<br> 
    <code>git clone git@git.niksula.hut.fi:YOUR_USER_NAME/wsd-material.git</code><br>
    this will authenticate you on the server with the SSH key you created in the
    previous step and create a folder with the name of wsd-material where the 
    contents of your repository from your server are cloned. If you did not change
    directories in Git Bash look for <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\wsd-material</code>.
  <pre>
    $ <strong>git clone git@git.niksula.hut.fi:YOUR_USER_NAME/wsd-material.git</strong>
    
    Cloning into 'wsd-material'...
    remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
    remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Checking connectivity... done.
  </pre>
  <p class="warning">Note that GitLab also has a feature where you can download
    your project. If you download your project instead of cloning you will not 
    be able to submit your exercises.
  </p> 

  <h3>4. Solving The Exercise</h3>
  <p>Open up exercises/01_tools/hello.html on your favorite code editor... or if 
    you don't have a code editor read <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/">review of editors</a> that are particularly
    well suited for this course.
  </p>

  <p>You are free to edit the hello.html file to test things out, 
    it just needs to match following four criteria so you get the points
    from this exercise:
  </p>
     <ul>
      <li>Document hello.html will be valid html5</li>
      <li>Content of the meta element with the name of author will be changed</li>
      <li>Content of em with the id of signature will be changed</li>
      <li>The changed meta and #id will be the same</li>
    </ul>


  <h3>5. Add, Commit and Push changes</h3>
  <p>
    After you've modified the hello.html file, you need to commit your
    modifications. First check the status of the project:</p>
  <pre>
    $ <strong>git status</strong>

    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

            modified:   exercises/01_tools/hello.html

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
  </pre>

  <p>To <em>stage</em> files for a commit you first need to <em>add</em> them. Note that add does not refer to adding a new file to your project but adding a file to a commit.</p>
  <pre>
    $ <strong>git add exercises/01_tools/hello.html</strong>
  </pre>
  Again you can check with git status that the file will be included in the
  commit:
  <pre>
    $ <strong>git status</strong>

    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

          modified:   exercises/01_tools/hello.html
  </pre>
  <p>Now you can commit these changes to your repository with <code>git commit</code>. 
    It will open a text editor (on linux the default is typically vim) where you can write
    a message for the commit that reflects the changes that you've done. 
    You can also just type the commit message alongside the command with -m switch, for example:</p>
  <pre>
    $ <strong>git commit -m "Solved the first exercise"</strong>
    [master ab66b8d] Solved the first exercise
    1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletion(-)
  </pre>
  <p>Now the commit is done and the changes you've made to the files that
    you committed are tracked in the repository history. 
    You can verify this by command: <code>git log</code>.The first entry should look
    something like this:</p>
  <pre>
    $ <strong>git log</strong>
    commit 2b9c171c4f051cd46b5ce3d77141aaef5bfdce9a
    Author: Firstname Lastname &lt;YOUR_USER_NAME@niksula.hut.fi&gt;
    Date:   Sun Oct 12 19:01:29 2014 +0300

    Solved the first exercise
  </pre>

  <p>
    What remains is pushing these changes to your repository in GitLab. 
    This can be done with: <code>git push</code>:
  </p>
  <pre>
    $ <strong>git push</strong>
    Counting objects: 7, done.
    Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 345 bytes, done.
    Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@git.niksula.hut.fi:xxxxxxxx/wsd-material.git
    eb2fdc8..ab66b8d  master -> master
  </pre>
  <p>If there were no errors the changes are now reflected in 
    GitLab (you can browse your project's files if you want to verify this).
  </p>


  <h3>6. Submitting Your Project to A+</h3>

  <p>Submitting your solution is similar to the first exercise. Just copy and
    paste your GitLab project's URL to A-plus.</p>
