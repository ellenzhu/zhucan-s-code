        <h2>Course - Lecture Slides</h2>
        <p>Only this slide set will be posted to <a href="https://noppa.aalto.fi/noppa/kurssi/cse-c3210/">Noppa</a>. Rest of the material is obtained from the course repository (explained later).</p>
        <p>To create files for printing to pdf append <code>?print-pdf</code> to the url.</p>
        <p>If you want to print to paper, you change 
        <pre><code>link.href = 'lib/reveal.js-2.6.2/css/print/pdf.css';// from
link.href = 'lib/reveal.js-2.6.2/css/print/paper.css'; //to</code></pre>
        <p>If you don't understand what those mean, don't worry. It will become clear.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Slide Notation</h2>
        <p class="lecture_quiz">&#9733;</p>
        <p>Specific terms and commands within the text will be marked with &lt;code&gt; element. Code samples look like this:</p>
        <pre><code>//JavaScript sample
alert("Hello World!");</code></pre>
        <p>Slides are also color-coded. This slide has the default background. Colors roughly correspond to </p>
        <p><span class="box html_color" style="color: white; padding: 1%;">HTML</span>
          <span class="box css_color" style="color: white; padding: 1%;">CSS</span>
          <span class="box js_color" style="color: white; padding: 1%;">JavaScript</span>
          <span class="box python_color" style="color: white; padding: 1%;">Python &amp; Django</span>
        </p>
        <p>Earn extra points for the exam when slides are marked with a star (more on that later).</p>
        <p class="extra">Extra material looks like this. They usually contain links to useful material that go beyond the course content.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Course - Exercises</h2>
        <p>Seven rounds of exercises covering five general topics:</p>
        <ul class="dense">
          <li>Setting Up Tools</li>
          <li>HTML/CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript 1</li>
          <li>JavaScript 2</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Django 1</li>
          <li>Django 2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the very least you must pass one exercise round from each topic: Tools, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django.</p>
        <p>Passing all seven exercise rounds will give +1 towards the final course grade.</p>
        <p>Failing to complete a round from each of the topic <em>will result in a failing grade from the course</em>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Exercise Groups</h2>
        <p>There are exercise groups available every Wednesday after the lecture (14:15-16:00 T7/CS building) starting from tomorrow.</p>
        <p>There is no mandatory attendance. The exercise group is there for you as a service to use if needed.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Course - Exam</h2>
        <p>Sign up for the exam in Oodi. Passing the exam is mandatory, exam is graded fail, pass, pass +1. </p>
        <p>Exam times: 18.12.2014 9.00-12.00 and 16.02.2015 13.00-16.00</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Course - Project</h2>
        <p>During spring of 2015 there is a course project that is completed in groups of 3 people.</p>
        <p>In the project you will create in teams a web service. The project topic and framework is set.</p>
        <p>The project grading is as follows: fail, +1, +2, +3 to course grade. Note that this will contribute the most for your final grade, that is an indication where the largest work load is.</p>
        <p>We'll talk more about this later.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Course - Grading</h2>
        <p>Your final grade will be the sum of your grades as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Exercises: fail, pass, +1</li>
          <li>Exam: fail, pass, +1</li>
          <li>Project: fail, +1, +2, +3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Area</th><th>Result</th><th>Effect on Grade</th></tr>
          <tr><td>Exercises</td><td>Six rounds completed</td><td> +0</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Exam</td><td>Pass with +1</td><td> +1</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Project</td><td>Completed with 2</td><td> +2</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Course</td><td></td><td><strong>3</strong></td></tr>
        </table>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <p>Exercises are done in <a href="https://plus.cs.hut.fi/">A+</a>.</p>
        <p>There are two types of exercises: multiple choice questions and git-exercises.</p>
        <p>Multiple choice questions are answered in A+.</p>
        <p>All other exercises apart from multiple choice ones are completed using <code>git</code> and submitted by entering your repository <code>URL</code> to A+.</p>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        <p><img src="img/git.png" alt="git"></p>
        <p>Git can be downloaded from <a href="http://git-scm.com">http://git-scm.com</a>. There is also a <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en">freely available book</a> on the site. Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 cover most of what is needed on the course.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>GIT on This Course</h2>
        <p>You will first <code>fork</code> (once) the official material repository. Then you will <code>clone</code> it to your local computer. You work on exercises and <code>commit</code> your work locally. Then you will <code>push</code> those commits to your GitLab repository (and at this point you can submit your work in A+ to be graded).</p>
        <p>Exercise instructions for the first round can be found in A+ and in the course repository.</p>
        <p>The rest of the rounds will have <em>instructions only in the repository</em>.</p>
        <p>Instructions to get you started with the course workflow are in A+ in the exercises <a href="https://plus.cs.hut.fi/exercise/644/">Exercise 01 - Getting Started With GitLab</a> and <a href="https://plus.cs.hut.fi/exercise/643/">Exercise 02 - Getting Started With Git</a>.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Third Exercise</h2>
        <p>If your browser is relatively up to date this exercise can be completed without any additional browser extensions.</p>
        <p>The idea is to get you acquainted with browser tools to inspect web pages.</p>
        <p>It is a good idea to load the page with the browser tools open, so request and response content is stored.</p>
        <p>If you do not have a recent browser, download one as soon as you can. It has been tested with recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, IE10+, and Opera. And Safari works too, but you need to manually enable the developer tools first.</p>
